Absolutely—here’s a warmer, more human-friendly README that matches the files and keeps setup simple.

# Tiny C Web Server

A small project: a simple HTTP server written in C that serves a couple of HTML pages and a CSS file. It’s great for learning sockets, basic HTTP, and a sprinkle of routing without big frameworks.[1][2][3]

## What’s inside

- HTTP_Server.{h,c}: opens a TCP socket, binds a port, and listens for connections.
- main.c: accepts a client, parses the first request line, matches a route, and sends back a response.
- Routes.{h,c}: tiny binary search tree to register and look up routes like “/” and “/about”.
- Response.{h,c}: reads a file into memory so it can be sent in the HTTP response.
- templates/: index.html, about.html, 404.html — the pages shown for /, /about, and unknown routes.
- static/: index.css — a single stylesheet that can be requested under /static/.
- compile_commands.json: handy for editors and tools that use clangd or ccls.

## Quick start

1) Create folders:
- mkdir -p include src templates static

2) Place files:
- include: HTTP_Server.h, Routes.h, Response.h
- src: HTTP_Server.c, Routes.c, Response.c, main.c
- templates: index.html, about.html, 404.html
- static: index.css

3) Build:
- gcc -Iinclude -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -O2 -g -o websrv \
  src/HTTP_Server.c src/Routes.c src/Response.c src/main.c

4) Run:
- ./websrv
- Open http://127.0.0.1:6969/ in a browser or:
  - curl -v http://127.0.0.1:6969/
  - curl -v http://127.0.0.1:6969/about

## How routing works

- Routes are registered in main.c with a tiny BST:
  - “/” -> templates/index.html
  - “/about” -> templates/about.html
- Anything else falls back to templates/404.html.

Static files
- Requests containing “/static/” are meant to serve from ./static (currently hardcoded to index.css). It’s a good place to add images, CSS, or JS later.

## Notes and next steps

This code is intentionally minimal to keep the learning curve gentle. A few improvements worth tackling next.
- Send a proper Content-Length and Content-Type header.
- Handle errors from socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), read(), send().
- Parse the request line more carefully (CRLF, method/path) and avoid fragile strtok usage.
- Generalize static file serving and prevent “..” path traversal.
- Replace strcat with snprintf to avoid buffer overflows.

Want help polishing those? Happy to provide small patches or a PR-style diff to make it production-friendlier while staying simple.
